# HSI extensions repository

This repository will contain a collection of small front-end and/or back-end modules meant to be consumed by our HSI instance via direct URLs (extensions are added this way).

## Structure

Each project/module is self contained in it's own folder:

```
/blog-button/
├── definition.json
├── index.html
└── main.js
```

## Development

- Each folder is standalone.
- Currently no build steps are required.
- Keep code lightweight.
